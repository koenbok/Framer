For a complete overview, downloads and docs please visit [framerjs.com](http://www.framerjs.com).

### About

Framer is a modern prototyping tool. It can help you to quickly build and test complex interactions and rich animations for both desktop and mobile.

### Developing

To start developing, clone the code and install the dependencies with `npm install`. To make a new build run `make build` or `make buildw` to keep watching and rebuild on file changes.

### Tests

To run the tests run `make test` or `make testw` to keep watching and test on file changes. The tests are run in PhantomJS, a headless version of WebKit. You can also run the tests in the browser directly by simply opening `test/index.html`.
