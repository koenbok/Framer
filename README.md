Framer - www.framerjs.com

Framer is a modern prototyping tool for Webkit browsers. It can help you to quickly build and test complex interactions and rich animations for WebKit-based browsers on both desktop ( eg Safari, Chrome, eventually Opera ) and mobile ( Safari, Chrome, Android, and various other WebKit-based mobile browsers ). Framer does not currently support Firefox / Gecko because it relies on non-standard WebKit CSS transforms.
